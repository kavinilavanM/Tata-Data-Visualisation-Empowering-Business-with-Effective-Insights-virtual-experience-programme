The virtual experience programme is provided by Tata iQ or Tata Insights and Quants. I discover how passionate, multidisciplinary experts utilise data visualisation technologies like Tableau and Power BI to take on some of the most difficult business problems and uncover fascinating insights buried in the mountains of produced data.

The programme demonstrates the kind of issues dealt with by Tata Insights and Quants every day and makes an effort to imitate the difficulties an individual could have.

### Task includes 
* ♦ Framing the Business Scenario

♦ Communicating Insights and Analysis


### Task - 1
As a consultant for an online retail store, the task is to provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business by analyzing their data. The aim is to evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion. In preparation for the meeting, a set of questions that are relevant to both business leaders is required. For the CEO, questions around revenue trends, revenue breakdown by product category, operational inefficiencies, and competitive position are relevant. On the other hand, questions for the CMO would revolve around marketing channels, customer demographics, customer satisfaction levels, and brand perception. The insights generated from answering these questions would guide the presentation and help the management make strategic plans for the business.
